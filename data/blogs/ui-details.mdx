# Small UI Details Made a Big Difference

When I started building real projects, I quickly learned that **small details** can make or break a user experience. Here are some lessons I've gathered along the way.

## Spacing Matters More Than You Think

Consistent spacing isn't just about aesthetics—it creates visual hierarchy and improves readability. I learned to use a spacing scale (4px, 8px, 16px, 24px, 32px) instead of arbitrary values.

Some things I started doing:

- Using consistent padding within cards and sections
- Adding breathing room between text elements
- Aligning elements to a grid system

## Typography Creates Hierarchy

The right font pairing can elevate a simple design to something professional. I started paying attention to:

- **Font weights** to create visual distinction
- **Line height** for better readability
- **Letter spacing** for headings

## The Takeaway

UI design isn't just about making things look pretty—it's about making experiences that feel natural and easy to use. Small improvements compound over time.
