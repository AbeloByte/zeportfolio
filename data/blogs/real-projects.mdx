# Things I Wish I Knew Before Real Projects

The jump from learning to code to working on real projects was bigger than I expected. Here's what surprised me.

## Code Quality Matters (A Lot)

In tutorials, you just need code that works. In real projects:

- Other people have to read your code
- You have to read your code six months later
- Bugs hide in messy code

I started writing cleaner code not because it was "best practice" but because debugging became easier.

## Communication Is Half the Battle

Technical skills get you in the door, but communication keeps projects moving:

- **Ask questions early** instead of guessing
- **Document decisions** so you don't forget why you did something
- **Give updates** even when there's nothing exciting to report

## Deadlines Change Everything

When you're learning, there's no rush. Real projects have:

- Stakeholders waiting on features
- Dependencies between team members
- Scope that keeps expanding

Learning to estimate time accurately and push back on unrealistic timelines is a skill on its own.

## The Mindset Shift

Moving from "I need to finish this exercise" to "We need to ship this feature" changed how I approach problems. Now I think about maintainability, edge cases, and user experience from the start.
