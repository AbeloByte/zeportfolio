# Building Responsive UI the Hard Way

Responsive design sounds simple in theory: use media queries, set breakpoints, done. But in practice, I've learned that building truly responsive UIs requires much more attention to detail.

## The Device Testing Reality

I used to rely on browser dev tools to test responsiveness. That changed when I saw my "perfect" layouts broken on actual devices:

- **iOS Safari** handles viewport differently than Chrome
- **Android devices** have wildly different screen densities
- **Tablets** are often forgotten but still widely used

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Mobile-First Actually Works

Starting with the smallest screen and progressively adding complexity saves a lot of headaches.

### 2. Use Relative Units

`rem` and `em` for typography, `%` and `vw/vh` for layout—these scale better than fixed pixels.

### 3. Test Early, Test Often

Don't wait until the end to check responsiveness. Build with flexibility in mind from day one.

## What I Do Now

- Test on real devices when possible
- Use container queries for component-level responsiveness
- Keep a checklist of common breakpoints to verify
